                <description>The War Room::Been banned? Complaint or problem? Post here.&lt;br /&gt;
Just checking on my account status. I played last night with a few friends for the first time in years, and now when I try to log on, it tells me I am banned for 158 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is tonight I am playing on a new laptop instead of my desktop gaming rig.</description>

I&#039;m planning to take down the TripleA 1.8 lobby at the end of this week. If there are any objections please voice them before then.</description>

You need to fix the italian sub in the arabian sea. That single unit can have a major impact on the UK in round 1. If it hits both boats and survives, not only is it a loss of 14 PUs for the UK, but it blocks UK boats in SZ56 from attacking W.Iran. This could easily be fixed by moving the UK destroyer and transport from SZ57 to SZ58.</description>

If you are defending with one infantry, a defender no longer has to click in battles for the action to proceed) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Development process and code hosting: &lt;br /&gt;- code hosting has been moved fully out of source forge into github. We&#039;ve picked up the pace of changes and have added some additional developers along the way.  The source forge forum will be around for some time, but the admin team is looking for a replacement technology to unify the many community tripleA forums that are out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goals for future releases: &lt;br /&gt;- upgrade the UI code to a more modern version. The current UI technology has roots from the last century. &lt;br /&gt;- allow true future compatibility of game saves. This will allow you to natively continue playing save games with updated game engines. Before the game would launch an old instance of itself, which can work sometimes, but is flawed since map compatibility is not handled very well. &lt;br /&gt;- additional code simplification, this is going to allow us to add improve and add features at a more sustainable and even accelerated rate. (Today the code is a bit of a tangle, makes it overly time consuming to work with) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect releases after that will be much more incremental and frequent, and will likely be much more feature oriented. New devs are able and willing to jump in are very welcome, and perhaps there might be some surprises in what folks may contribute to the code base.</description>

Thank you very much for the links! I can&#039;t really explain what the Strong AI has done better. It was just too easy to beat the Hard AI after losing twice against the Strong AI on the same map.</description>

hi redrum, thnx for picking up the responsibility, also agree the ai is much better then before (as i have tested it alot).&lt;br /&gt;On the platform am kinda divided, agree with epi to consolidate it into one but i also think sourceforge is more known then triplea website. Maybe keep sourceforge with links redirecting to our web site?</description>
