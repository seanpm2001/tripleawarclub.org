                <description>Strategy::WW II Classic Hard AI always wins as Allies&lt;br /&gt;
To answer your question: no; aside from extremely favourable dice, you can&#039;t win against a very good Classic Allies player, playing the game as-is, due to how much unbalanced in favour of Allies the game is. Against the Allies HardAI (not actually Hard at all), you need to be better enough to overcome this disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you play as Allies, you probably should give more than 20 Bid to the Axis HardAI, or restricting yourself from attacking with Russia on the first turn.</description>

I was finally successful following your advice. Took Moscow in round 14. Won the game in round 33. Minsk is indeed a good place. Long range vehicles are key to win...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks!&lt;br /&gt;MM&lt;br /&gt;Quote:&lt;div class=&quot;xoopsQuote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ice wrote:&lt;br /&gt;WEl  have 0 experience with any ai, so all my strategys are based upon human vs human games. i have no clue what the ai does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but ill try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. difficult answer, it has to do with killing reims with airunits, taking belgium and lille (noncombat armor frankfurt to lille) buying trucks, attacking switserland with italy 1 battleround, so that the air can land in lille. the exact details are up to you to discover :) but point is to kill as many frenchmen who can reach paris, and make sure lille survives so that in round 2 ur extra trucks or halftacks can reach paris aswel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cant answer that, 1000 things can influence a phurcase. but also im on a totaly different experience level with maybe 200-400 games under my belt on nwo. but i gues its better to buy 30 armored cars then 50 infantry when ur westcoast is totaly safe. or you work in steps, frontline infantrys/artillerys. second line of factorys armor/cars 3th line trucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. YES, much better then an austria factory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. maybe yes maybe no. can i take leningrad in the same proces, can i make the defence very expensive (so i kill allot of russias armor for instance) can i retake after russia took finland. so easy answer, only defend if its a cheap defence, but putting 20-40-60 dudes in finland is a waste of german recources. rather use some air maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. if you play on lowluck, yes 11 is the minimum, but do you really wanna buy halftrucks in turn 2? i usualy bring 13-14armor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goodluck &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ice&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                <description>Strategy::Allies always lose&lt;br /&gt;
Attached is a revised game with good play on both sides. I&#039;ve played over 700 games of revised and would consider myself among the top 5-10 players on the map. At high levels, both players recognize all unfavorable battles, so you end up with huge stacks and trading at the borders. It&#039;s not uncommon to have 30-40 round grinding games with over 3000 TUV and nearly no battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Overall, Russia is way too passive. West russia is a point of strength for russia, and russia effectively concedes it for free round 1.&lt;br /&gt;- Russia R1 buy should be 3 tanks, 3 inf. 8 infantry is too passive and concedes karelia for free R1.&lt;br /&gt;- Taking West Russia R1 as Russia is required. Assuming germany bids to ukraine, standard is 3 inf, 3 tanks, 1 art, 2 fig ukr, everything else to Wrussia. To give you a sense of how big the difference is, I pretty much know 100% that axis will win after Russia&#039;s R1 move and buy.&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid trading as Russia. For example, choose to attack 1 territory with 1 inf, 2 fig instead of 2 territories with 2 inf and 1 fig. With strength, look for opportunities to attack and stack territories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- UK R1 is too passive. uk should land africa, karelia or archangel. Africa is generally best and is safe so long as germany has no more than 5 fig, 1 bomb. with 5 fig, 1 bomb it&#039;s about an even trade, but trading evenly is very disadvantageous for germany.&lt;br /&gt;- In general uk should buy trans, inf, tanks, art, and fighters. Their role is to threaten pressure on the germany territories. this forces the germanys to play passively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- US R1 typical buy is 1 car, 1 trans, 6 inf or something similar. 2 carriers is too defense and slows deployment.&lt;br /&gt;- in general, US should buy transports, infantry, tanks, and a few artillery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Honestly, the Axis play is really poor as well&lt;br /&gt;- Germany buys too many tanks. A good allies will place so much pressure from US or UK that germany needs the infantry defensive values. It&#039;s not uncommon to buy nothing but infantry for 5-10 rounds.&lt;br /&gt;- Japan 2 factory R1 is strictly inferior to 3 transports. Anytime I see Axis do that, I know I have an auto-win against them. It also indicates that the player hasn&#039;t thought much about the game to realize why 2 factories are strictly inferior to 3 transports R1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My summary review of the game is that Allies played way too passive and concedes tons of territory that it didn&#039;t need to. Especially Russia. Axis played hyper-aggressively in a very suboptimal way but got a free pass because of the allied passiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies actually have a huge advantage in Revised. If I were to play both sides without bid, I&#039;d suspect that allies would win 85-90% of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if anyone would like some clarifications.</description>

RIP GTO...&lt;br /&gt;My basic R1 Russian buy is 4 inf, 3 art&lt;br /&gt;R1 Combat Atttack W.russia 9 inf,2art,1arm&lt;br /&gt;          Strafe Ukr, 3inf,3arm,2figs....pulling out after round1 dice, retreating into cauc&lt;br /&gt;R1 Non Combat 2figs land in cauc, Pull asian inf, 2inf from kaz to cauc, all others toward moscow, save 1 for bury&lt;br /&gt;Deploy 2inf 2art to cauc, rest moscow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary overall strategy..The 3 arty buy allows me to not buy the 3rd russian fig if combat goes poorly rd1,( i.e. lose to many inf) OR an increased attack value if G1 naval buy. If rd1 combat goes good, i buy 3rd fig and inf rd2, and all inf rounds after that using spare change for occasional arm. Rest is pretty basic, stack W. Rus, trade ukr and kar, maybe belo if and when. and hold until J starts showing up to shift east&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

6 Russian infantry R1 is a mistake by Russia.&lt;br /&gt;Under most optimal j1 moves, Japan wont attack bury even with only 1 Russia infantry there. The reason is that that infantry is best used for pushing into China and start trading sinkiang. Russia provides Japan with a huge option and leaves infantry out of position which would be better used around sinkiang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, hit bury and attack pearl with 1 sub, 1 dest, 1 fig, 1 bomber. If UK also takes Borneo with all available naval, I would probably hit pearl and UK navy, sparing bury. The bury territory structure is very favorable for axis, so its no problem for Japan to take r2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no player in my list of the top 20 that ever stacks bury r1. I honestly don&#039;t mean to be arrogant, but anyone who does is a strong indication that they don&#039;t understand high level Axis and Allies mechanics.</description>

                <description>Strategy::A&amp;A Revised:  Germany&lt;br /&gt;
Bids: Empirically, the 80+% of the top 20 players bid 3 infantry. 1 in Ukr, 1 in Wrussia, 1 in Libya. Placing the infantry in belorussia instead of West Russia is an option. When placing in West Russia, Germany chooses to trade 1 additional infantry with Russia, so expected value of remaining Russia units in West Russia at R1 is 5 inf, 1 art, 1 tank, 1AA. Placing the infantry in WR is 0.13 better than placing in Belorussia under low luck settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other bid option is 1 art, 1 tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 contested areas between Germany and Russia R1:&lt;br /&gt;1. Russia attacks and destroys ukraine units&lt;br /&gt;2. Germany gets to stack Karelia safely&lt;br /&gt;3. Germany gets to stack Egypt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With usual probabilities, Germany gets one of these 3. The 3 infantry germany bid allows Russia to choose either 1 or 2. Africa bid gives Germany #3 with no choice by Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______&lt;br /&gt;Typical R1 buy is 10 inf, 2 tanks. 10 inf, 1 fig or 12 inf, 1 art are also viable but uncommon. The is no player in the top 20 that I&#039;m aware of who buys anything else R1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note on why R1 Germany naval buys are bad. A classic example is a baltic carrier R1 is nearly an auto-win for allies given optimal play by both sides. The purchase sacrifices 5 infantry for Germany at an essential point. Allies are able to bully Germany, guaranteed stacking karelia R2, R3 and a very real risk of Ukr stack R5, baltic stack R6, and italy stack R7. UK buys 3 fighters a round and Germany is forced to choose to sharply escalate naval buys or lose the stack for almost free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;Why i&#039;m credible. I&#039;ve played over 600 games of Revised at the highest levels. Probably over 100 games exceeding 30 round, and experienced just about every outcome. transport sinking battleship, 40+ battleships, 1000 stack infs, etc. I&#039;ve written this content with a high level player in mind. Please message me or reply if you&#039;d like clarification.</description>

Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wondered about this at first, but it&#039;s actually quite simple. Both USA and Russia can&#039;t declare war on their own before round 4. The difference is, however, that USA is going to collect its war-bound extra income in round 3 if they are still at peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers&lt;br /&gt;Toni</description>

                <description>Strategy::A&amp;A Revised:  United Kingdom&lt;br /&gt;
....and, probably one of the most critical Round 1 decisions for the UK.  Presuming that Germany sends the full Baltic fleet to Sea Zone 7, which do you prefer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) attacking with air only (2 figs + bomber), or&lt;br /&gt;(2) attacking with the Battleship + 2 transports + 2 figs + bomber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notably, the UK can lose this full air force very early with some bad dice (and also presuming that the Axis select subs before the transport as the OOL).   I find this attack particularly frustrating, as it seems to happen to me more than expected.   However, some players prefer this option because it doesn&#039;t require the AC build, preferring instead to swing the AC from the Indian ocean around a few turns later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the naval + air attack, but there is risk here too, and as mentioned above, it does require an AC build to defend against German air.   Notably, both transports are needed in the attack, for some of the contingencies could involve losing the battleship (if only 1 transport), which is not too common, but risky enough.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>
