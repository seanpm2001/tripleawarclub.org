                <title>Are Challenges Too Scarce? [by vtgoalie22]</title>

                <description>1941/1942 Ladder::Are Challenges Too Scarce?&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Fellow Ladderers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relatively new to Triplea and even newer to the ladder, but in my short time I have come across multiple instances of finishing up a game and having both players desire a rematch, but neither player had a free challenge (they challenged 4 more players). I am working with a small sample size here so this may not be the norm, but it raises the question of whether there is a lack of available challenges in the ladder community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of understand why there is an incentive in place to ensure players be the challengie rather than always being the challenger. However, it seems possible with this system that available challenges in the ladder community are reducing over time (on average). For instance if ever a player retires after having been challenged more often then they challenged others, the total pool decreases. Over time it makes it harder to find matches even when multiple players are looking for games and have their challenge slots open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, new to the community so I am not sure if this is an actual issue, but if others feel the same way it may make sense to insert more challenges into the current system somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all for your time and I look forward to seeing you all on the game board!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VT</description>

There is also an section on this forum witch tells you step bye step how to start of an game with pictures etc to help you out. And you can also ask the other player if he can send you the file saves you some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripleawarclub.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=256&amp;forum=7&quot; title=&quot;http://www.tripleawarclub.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=256&amp;forum=7&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;http://www.tripleawarclub.org/modules ... .php?topic_id=256&amp;forum=7&lt;/a&gt;</description>

                <description>1941/1942 Ladder::41/42 game&lt;br /&gt;
I have to notice some strange things:&lt;br /&gt;- The players reported today in the Ann50 ladder are 120;&lt;br /&gt;- 89 challenges were lanunched since 1-1-2013 (Active or completed)&lt;br /&gt;- Only 33 palyers had played a challenge since 1-1-2013;&lt;br /&gt;- The players available for a PBEM game (any rule) are at the moment only 3 (paologvn, Jazzy, Blasherke);  &lt;br /&gt;- The players available for a on line challenge are only 3 (Cleopatra, Ehudha, Allied)&lt;br /&gt;- the number of challenges reported as Active at tha moment (lanuched since 1-1-2013) is 19, but 5 of them (1621,1716, 1717, 1718) were asked to be cancelled since months, and other 5 are so old that probably were non asked to be cancelled from the palyers.   So the Callenges real active at the moment are only 9; &lt;br /&gt;- Some players seem to be disapperared (like mtmra or stephen 1224) after launching a Challenge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is:   where are the other players? (120-33=87);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I propose againt that every year the list of players should be cleaned from all the players that have not played at least a game in the year.   </description>

                <description>1941/1942 Ladder::axis win rate too high. why not try a new ladder rule?&lt;br /&gt;
I like the double match aswel since you have to master both game plays.&lt;br /&gt;I was just trolling the forums and saw this topic and just wanted to state it is in the rules to changes the rules as long many poeple want this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although i think 13 for allies makes allied gameplay harsh but now undoable. i wouldn&#039;t now any other fair bid aswel. Yet if i loock at yammo and Centazins win rate it should be good done to win with bid 13 aswel. Poeple just dont have the wrigth strat for it.</description>

                <description>1941/1942 Ladder::Kiangsu&lt;br /&gt;
Wel you should also consider then Burma,Wake island,New genuiea,Kiangsu, Philliphine islans,Borneo,East indies and Solomon island in 1942. Since japan owns those TT there in begin aswel and you wont gain an NO bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This online version game is correct i have original game at home and there you wont gain bonus aswel in Kiangsu. Although the boardgame map you can easily see Kiangsu is not from japan but from china although japan start there. So i think the map of this onlinegame set some confusion. Since you can&#039;t realy see it belongs to china. Although this is spoken in the rules as exceptions. It migth help though to make an small map change and put an chinees mark on kiangsu. but i dont know how you want to solve tath in 1942 version it wil be alot of map changes.</description>
