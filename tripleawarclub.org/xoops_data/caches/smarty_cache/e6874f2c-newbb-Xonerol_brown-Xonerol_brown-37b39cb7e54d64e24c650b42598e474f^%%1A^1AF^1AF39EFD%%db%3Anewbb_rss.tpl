                <description>Tournament of Champions - Revised::Revised ToC9 Championship&lt;br /&gt;
Well, it is the winner&#039;s prerogative to post the game result, but I see epinikion hasn&#039;t for 3 days, so I figured I would.  Epinikion (Axis +9) defeats bayder (Allies) in Russia2 by surrender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game ended before it could really get started as the Russians experienced a loss of one of it&#039;s fighters after a failing on a 99% attack in Burytia (3 inf, 1 ftr against 1 inf, 1 tank...all units died).  Against some opponents I would strive to overcome a 1% fluke result early in a game, but against a strong opponent like epi, it wasn&#039;t worth the struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to epi on joining the ranks of ToC Champions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAST Revised ToC Champions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToC1 Champion:  Incy (runner-up:  bayder)&lt;br /&gt;ToC2 Champion:  Serghis (runner-up:  Horemheb)&lt;br /&gt;ToC3 Champion:  Serghis (runner-up:  bayder)&lt;br /&gt;ToC4 Champion:  Bas (runner-up:  baxter)&lt;br /&gt;ToC5 Champion:  bayder (runner-up:  baxter)&lt;br /&gt;ToC6 Champion:  polarole (runner-up:  baxter)&lt;br /&gt;ToC7 Champion:  bayder (runner-up:  Undine)&lt;br /&gt;ToC8 Champion:  bayder (runner-up:  CmdData)&lt;br /&gt;ToC9 Champion:  epinikion (runner-up:  bayder)</description>

CmdData (Axis) defeats Straha (Allies) bid 9 by surrender after J26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bid was 1 inf Libya, 1 inf Ukraine, and 1 inf Belorussia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Allies kept Karelia stacked from round 3 until round 23 while Germany maintained an Eastern Europe stack as long as possible (had to vacate on G23). Germany bounced it&#039;s other smaller stack between SE and WE in order to free up the planes for trading the other territories of Ukraine, Balkans, and Belo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan had a slow start but finally stacked Persia on J13 while also annoying Alaska &amp; W. Canada from rounds 7 through 24. Japan finally had gathered enough force to move the Persia stack to Kazakh on J22 while still maintaining control of the Suez due to 12 transports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Allies opted to push the Russian stack into Ukraine on R23 to go for a double (or triple) tap on Berlin instead of doing a turtle in Moscow. Japan flew in as many fighters as it could into Berlin and captured Moscow and the rest of Asia and then stacked Caucasus and Egypt on J24. The remainder of Africa (minus Algeria and Libya) quickly became Japanese. The Allies could never a combination of attacks that would lead to a fall of Berlin and Japan stacked West Russia medium on J25 and more heavily on J26 with that stack looking to move to Belo on J27 or J28.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the point of surrender, Berlin was defended by 157 inf, 4 art, 10 arm, 2 AA guns, 17 figs (12 of which were Japanese), and a Japanese bomber. The Axis had 442 units to the Allied 412 units. TUV was 1889 Axis to 1819 Allies. PUs on hand was 88 Axis and 74 Allies (Karelia and Norway were still Russian red). Russia had 138 units for 513 TUV. Germany 180 units for 617 TUV. British 149 units for 611 TUV. Japan 262 units for 1272 TUV. US 125 units for 695 TUV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thoroughly amazing game Straha and I think we both had a lot of fun! I felt behind for much of this game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GG and well played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CmdData</description>

bayder (Axis +9) defeats Undine (Allies) in Round USA11 via surrender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany placed a split bid in Europe and Africa, and the game started with fairly standard moves by both sides: Russia stacking WR, Germany stacking Kar, UK and USA dropping in Alg, and Japan clearing Allied ships and building transports. The Japanese transport in sz59 survived UK&#039;s DD attack, setting up Japan to capture the Pacific islands by round 4, while building up troops in Egy and Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan&#039;s lucky transport survival was countered by Allied luck of relentless strategic bombing of Germany, resulting in UK capturing and stacking Kar in round 5...holding it for 2 rounds before Germany was able to force them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the south, Axis maintained a stack in Egy through round 7, allowing most of the Japanese fleet into the Med to lock down sz14 defense, protecting the underbelly of Germany. Around this time, UK and USA began dropping massive amounts of troops into WEur, forcing Germany to lose a lot of units in continuously retaking...until Germany was finally able to stack WEur in round 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Axis controlled Africa early, USA was able to root them out, and eventually stack Egy themselves. They also built subs and air, and finally forced the Axis fleet to retreat to sz15 and sz16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Japan retreated from Egy, they stacked Per, then Kaz, then finally Cauc. USA breaking through the Med blockade was too late to get enough aid to Russia. And, with Moscow&#039;s fall inevitable in J12, and Berlin comfortably defended, the Allied commanders offered their surrender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Undine for his top-notch play and sportsmanship throughout a very entertaining game.

#2 baxter vs. #5 polarole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;polarole axis wins after allies surrendering in uk1. a disastrous turn for uk keeping the jap trn alive, losing heavily in sz7, failing counter egy, and dont taking ngu left the allies frustrated and surrendering. unfortunatly the dierolls denied us another long and interesting game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for playing&lt;br /&gt;bye&lt;br /&gt;polarole</description>
