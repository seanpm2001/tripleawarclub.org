                <description>Strategy::WW II Classic Hard AI always wins as Allies&lt;br /&gt;
To answer your question: no; aside from extremely favourable dice, you can&#039;t win against a very good Classic Allies player, playing the game as-is, due to how much unbalanced in favour of Allies the game is. Against the Allies HardAI (not actually Hard at all), you need to be better enough to overcome this disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you play as Allies, you probably should give more than 20 Bid to the Axis HardAI, or restricting yourself from attacking with Russia on the first turn.</description>

Just checking on my account status. I played last night with a few friends for the first time in years, and now when I try to log on, it tells me I am banned for 158 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is tonight I am playing on a new laptop instead of my desktop gaming rig.</description>

You need to fix the italian sub in the arabian sea. That single unit can have a major impact on the UK in round 1. If it hits both boats and survives, not only is it a loss of 14 PUs for the UK, but it blocks UK boats in SZ56 from attacking W.Iran. This could easily be fixed by moving the UK destroyer and transport from SZ57 to SZ58.</description>

                <description>Strategy::NWO as Axis agains Hard AI&lt;br /&gt;
I was finally successful following your advice. Took Moscow in round 14. Won the game in round 33. Minsk is indeed a good place. Long range vehicles are key to win...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks!&lt;br /&gt;MM&lt;br /&gt;Quote:&lt;div class=&quot;xoopsQuote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ice wrote:&lt;br /&gt;WEl  have 0 experience with any ai, so all my strategys are based upon human vs human games. i have no clue what the ai does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but ill try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. difficult answer, it has to do with killing reims with airunits, taking belgium and lille (noncombat armor frankfurt to lille) buying trucks, attacking switserland with italy 1 battleround, so that the air can land in lille. the exact details are up to you to discover :) but point is to kill as many frenchmen who can reach paris, and make sure lille survives so that in round 2 ur extra trucks or halftacks can reach paris aswel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cant answer that, 1000 things can influence a phurcase. but also im on a totaly different experience level with maybe 200-400 games under my belt on nwo. but i gues its better to buy 30 armored cars then 50 infantry when ur westcoast is totaly safe. or you work in steps, frontline infantrys/artillerys. second line of factorys armor/cars 3th line trucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. YES, much better then an austria factory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. maybe yes maybe no. can i take leningrad in the same proces, can i make the defence very expensive (so i kill allot of russias armor for instance) can i retake after russia took finland. so easy answer, only defend if its a cheap defence, but putting 20-40-60 dudes in finland is a waste of german recources. rather use some air maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. if you play on lowluck, yes 11 is the minimum, but do you really wanna buy halftrucks in turn 2? i usualy bring 13-14armor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goodluck &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ice&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If you are defending with one infantry, a defender no longer has to click in battles for the action to proceed) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Development process and code hosting: &lt;br /&gt;- code hosting has been moved fully out of source forge into github. We&#039;ve picked up the pace of changes and have added some additional developers along the way.  The source forge forum will be around for some time, but the admin team is looking for a replacement technology to unify the many community tripleA forums that are out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goals for future releases: &lt;br /&gt;- upgrade the UI code to a more modern version. The current UI technology has roots from the last century. &lt;br /&gt;- allow true future compatibility of game saves. This will allow you to natively continue playing save games with updated game engines. Before the game would launch an old instance of itself, which can work sometimes, but is flawed since map compatibility is not handled very well. &lt;br /&gt;- additional code simplification, this is going to allow us to add improve and add features at a more sustainable and even accelerated rate. (Today the code is a bit of a tangle, makes it overly time consuming to work with) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect releases after that will be much more incremental and frequent, and will likely be much more feature oriented. New devs are able and willing to jump in are very welcome, and perhaps there might be some surprises in what folks may contribute to the code base.</description>
