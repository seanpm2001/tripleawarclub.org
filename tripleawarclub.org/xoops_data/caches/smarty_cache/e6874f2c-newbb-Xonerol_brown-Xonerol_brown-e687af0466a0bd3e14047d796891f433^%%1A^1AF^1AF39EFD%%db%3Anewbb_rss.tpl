                <title>FFA map FeudalJapan [by KBG]</title>

                <description>Classic Ladder::FFA map FeudalJapan&lt;br /&gt;
Japan in the sixteenth century, a shogun is wanted. 17 fractions battle for the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the capitols the neutral power grows (and it grows big) while stupid A.I. warlords die their way. Your army has become rather different: You have the Ashigaru, which are supportable 1/1 minions, which are supported by a row of special units. The horses, which are used as landtransports for some kinds of units, may be helpful in a longer game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have not been played many games yet, but the diplomacy seems to be fine (Armies are in absence of tanks relatively small but there are also some usual transports by sea. So we got many things like in lets say revised, just without tanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, can I recommend: Yes. Is this map very good: Time will tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

                <title>FFA map Neuschwabenland [by KBG]</title>
                <link>http://www.tripleawarclub.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=2146</link>
                <description>Classic Ladder::FFA map Neuschwabenland&lt;br /&gt;
Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the most debatable maps in FFA. There are four player in four corners on four one square neutral islands, around them are big and small islands, and on each of these (except the German backyard) is worth full three points and empty from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, one could think but the fronts are quite boring. There is no space for complex tactics, everything comes down to Airforce supported backstrike assured breakthroughs, which means: mass. &lt;br /&gt;The diplomacy is rather simple, because if theres peace on one side there is total war on the other side to be expected, which forces my opponent to arrange with his other neighbor, which will make it 2v2 all the time. But who with whom? There is only one about equal constellation usually. If this is not taken (which in 2 of 3 cases is true) a minor side fights a major side and desperately needs the Betrayal of the second power against the first power before its too late.&lt;br /&gt;This will happen and, at some frustrating point for minor side, will come back to a free for all with two heavily favored sides. You barely can prevent this. Normally two sides get crushed and rejoin game when 2nd betrays 1st, and you just dont know when this will be.&lt;br /&gt;So: I dont recommend Neuschwabenland FFA so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>
