I read what you published, I recently played a game and you want to share with you.Now that you have a few skins. It&#039;s time for the fun part. Betting! Head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csgo4skin.com&quot; title=&quot;www.csgo4skin.com&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;www.csgo4skin.com&lt;/a&gt; Lounge and sign in through steam. On the home page will be a list of upcoming tournament matches. Look for something with very safe odds (80-90+%). Find a game you like and click on it to place a bet. Once you&#039;re confirmed your bet you&#039;ll receive a trade offer from one of their bots. Accept it to activate the bet.&lt;br /&gt;If the payout isn&#039;t very high for your bet, you may end up just getting your items back. Keep trying until you make a profit. Don&#039;t get impatient and bet on something with lower odds to get a higher payout. Always bet safe.</description>

If you don&#039;t want to spend a fortune opening cases, there is another option to get keys. Using Free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csgo4skin.com&quot; title=&quot;www.csgo4skin.com&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;www.csgo4skin.com&lt;/a&gt; you can get CS:GO keys for taking surveys online. Later on, you&#039;ll be able to buy/trade for keys easily with your profits, but this site is great if you&#039;re just starting out or don&#039;t want to spend your profits on keys. Usually it&#039;s better to just buy the skins you want instead of opening cases, but we all know how addicting it is.I read what you published, I recently played a game and you want to share with you.</description>

                <description>Revised Ladder::Delete Challenge Requests&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t know about ladders and should not copy paste anything out of the secreted admin only sub-forum, but, for giving some minimal info, this is part of what another mod told me there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ladders are working as long the Players only need basic mod support.[...]&lt;br /&gt;But we cant delete challenges[...], before we get somebody with coding skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was about 2 years ago, tho. I don&#039;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it would be advisable informing the users about the current state of the ladder system. My understanding is that (so far) nobody wants to do that, either (or maybe I&#039;m missing some post somewhere?).&lt;br /&gt;But TripleA recently got a new webmaster (that presented himself in the admin only sub-forum); so things might move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, this is almost all I know.</description>

                <title>Are Challenges Too Scarce? [by vtgoalie22]</title>

                <description>1941/1942 Ladder::Are Challenges Too Scarce?&lt;br /&gt;
Dear Fellow Ladderers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am relatively new to Triplea and even newer to the ladder, but in my short time I have come across multiple instances of finishing up a game and having both players desire a rematch, but neither player had a free challenge (they challenged 4 more players). I am working with a small sample size here so this may not be the norm, but it raises the question of whether there is a lack of available challenges in the ladder community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of understand why there is an incentive in place to ensure players be the challengie rather than always being the challenger. However, it seems possible with this system that available challenges in the ladder community are reducing over time (on average). For instance if ever a player retires after having been challenged more often then they challenged others, the total pool decreases. Over time it makes it harder to find matches even when multiple players are looking for games and have their challenge slots open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, new to the community so I am not sure if this is an actual issue, but if others feel the same way it may make sense to insert more challenges into the current system somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all for your time and I look forward to seeing you all on the game board!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VT</description>

Which maps in TripleA are used in the Revised ladder?  Is it &#039;World War II Revised&#039; and &#039;World War II Revised LHTR&#039; or &#039;World War II Revised LHTR&#039; and &#039;World War II v4&#039;?</description>
