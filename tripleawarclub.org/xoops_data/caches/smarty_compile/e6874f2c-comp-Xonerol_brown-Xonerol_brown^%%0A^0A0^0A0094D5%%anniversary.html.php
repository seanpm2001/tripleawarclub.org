<h2>0. General Conduct Rules</h2>
<p>The rules for conduct in the forums and lobby also apply to the ladder. They are described <a href="http://www.tripleawarclub.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=100&forum=1">here</a>.

<h2>1. Joining a Ladder</h2>

<p>Once you are registered on tripleawarclub.org, click the <b>Join Competition</b> link on the Ladder page to join a ladder.  
A valid email address is required to initiate challenges and report game
results. E-mail addresses are
periodically checked for validity, and invalid accounts will be being deleted.</p>
<p>If you will be playing PBEM games, the MARTI dice server (http://dice.tripleawarclub.org) is the <i>officially</i> recognized server to make dice rolls for the
game. In order to use the MARTI dice server, you must visit <a href="http://dice.tripleawarclub.org">http://dice.tripleawarclub.org</a> and register your email.
Note that when playing by email, you are not required to use any of the Post functions; turn summary, screenshot, or save game.</p>
<a name="provisional"></a>
<p>All new players joining the Ladder begin with a rating of 1000 points. New players begin within the Provisional class. Once a player has played 4 matches or has 2 consecutive match wins, whichever comes first, they exit the provisional class. These requirements will be increased 6months after the date above.</p>
<p>When you join a ladder competition, after you agree to these rules, the next page will ask you to update your ladder profile. This is important because your ladder profile is where your challenge slot is opened
or closed (the slot begins open). Your preferred game options/rules can also be selected. These options can be edited later using the <b>My Profile</b> link in the ladder menus.</p>

<h2>2. The Challenge System</h2>
<p>To challenge a player, log into the war club website, go to the ladder section, and click the Find Opponents link in the competition menu.</p>
<p>The Find Opponents page, shows wether a challenge can be made and which opponents are available (as per your preferred rules/options.) A player may only make challenges if the total number of
challenges made to other players does not exceed the total number
of challenges accepted from other players by three(3) (Note that this
is <i>Total</i> challenges--even if you play 50 games, the
difference can never be greater than 3). This forces players to
accept challenges from lower rated players if they want to continue
challenging higher rated players.</p><p>
To search for available opponents select the rules/options from the drop down boxes and submit. A player will be shown if all of the
following conditions are true:</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>(i) The challenged player has his challenge slot open</li>
<li>(ii) Both players have selected the same game rules/options</li>
<li>(iii) The absolute difference between the players ratings is &lt;=600</li>
</ul>
<!-- // not yet implemented // <p>Also, a player ranked 4th may always challenge players in the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions on the ratings board regardless of
their relative scores, subject to (i) and (ii) above.</p>-->
<p>It is possible that no-one will be listed in the box. This is not
an error. It is because no other players currently meet the conditions described above for a
valid challenge.</p>
<p>Next to each available player, you can see how many points could potentially be 
gained or lost for the match. Our system calculates the ratings when the games are 
reported, so it is only an estimate based on current ratings.</p>
<p>To generate a challenge, select an opponent and click the red challenge button next to their name. An automatic email is sent to both players informing them of the challenge.<br />
<p>At that point the players should contact one another to schedule the match and to decide on the rules and format (see details below.) An opponent's email can be found under the <b>Players</b>
link or in the challenging email sent by the ladder.</p>
<p>Once a challenge is made, the challenge slots of BOTH players are
closed. A player may reopen their slot at any time on the <b>My
Profiles</b> page.</p><p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of ongoing matches a player may
have; however, it is strongly suggested that players limit their
ongoing matches to 3 or less. There have been problems with players
making/accepting too many challenges and then losing some of them
because they were unable to make their moves in the required time
(see 6. slow play penalty).</p>

<h2>3. Match Format</h2>
<p>A match consists of two games played between player A and player B.
In game 1 player A is the Axis while player B is the Allies. In
game 2, player A is the Allies and player B is the Axis. For play by email, it is
suggested that both games be played simultaneously to speed up
play.</p>
<p>The winner of each game is the first to reach 15 (default)
Victory Cities at the end of the USA turn, or through surrender by a player.</p>
<h3>The following will be used in the matches:</h3>
<p>Axis &amp; Allies Anniversary Edition (AA50) Standard Rules and/or Low Luck rules. (These
options are selected in the <b>My Ladder Profile</b> link).</p>
<p><strong>Players must currently play with National Objectives on.</strong></p>
<p>The current stable version, as of the above date, of TripleA is <b>v1.2.5.4</b>.</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>For 1941 with regular luck (Dice), the Allies bid is set to 8 IPCs.</li>
<li>For 1941 with LowLuck (LL), the Allies bid is set to 13 IPCs(*)</li>
<li>For 1942 with regular luck (Dice), the Allies bid is set to 9 IPCs.</li>
<li>For 1942 with LowLuck (LL), the Allies bid is set to 9 IPCs</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(*) No bomber purchases are allowed for this game and bid combination</b></p>
<p>These IPCs may be spent on units to be placed on the board prior to game start. The IPC may be split the allies in any way. The first restriction is that no more than one unit may be placed per territory. Naval units must go into a sea zone with existing Naval units of the same nation. Placement of naval units in empty sea zones or placement of, for example, British units with American units (and vice versa) is not allowed. Similiarly, ground/air units must be placed in the territories controlled by the same nation. However, ground units may be placed in territories that have no existing ground/air units. 
<p>Unspent IPC's from the bid can be divided up between the Allies for spending in future turns as the Allied player desires.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of bugs and cheating are to be reported to the Admins immediately. 
Questions about the rules, crashed games, or newly discovered bugs which give one of the
players a benefit will have to be sent to the rules committee for
adjudication.</p>
<p>It is strictly forbidden to attack the enemies capital with
ground units <i>until after that power's first turn</i>. However,
strategic bombing raids and attacks with aircraft are allowed.</p>
<p>By default, tech rolling is OFF. Both players need to agree if tech is available to be rolled or not, <i>before starting the match</i>. Tech is either available for the
whole game, or not at all. If players cannot agree to play with or without tech before starting, request challenge deletion in the forums.</p>
<p>In cases where challenges were made and games WERE NOT started
prior to one player deleting their account, the matches will be
deleted and no points will be awarded.</p>
<p>In cases where challenges were made and games WERE started prior
to one player deleting their account, the matches will be valid and
points will be awarded to the opposing player.</p>
<p>A 3rd party dice server (such as MARTI at http://dice.tripleawarclub.org) is used to keep honest people honest. However, there are occasions where computers lock up during a dice roll or a player forgets to turn off their
firewall prior to making their dice rolls preventing results from
reaching the TripleA game. In these cases the following will
apply:</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>The FIRST time/date stamp result from MARTI is the <b>official</b> roll in case of duplicate rolls.</li>
<li>Battles resolved prior to the lockup (if the game was not saved after these battles) should be re-rolled in 
local so that the <i>net result</i> is the same as the original result.</li>
<li>In cases where the lockup occurred during a battle, the opponent
can choose to have a neutral player (administrator) roll the dice
or allow the player whose computer locked up to re-roll the dice
using MARTI. But it is the opposing player's choice.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Order of Losses (OOL)</h4>
<p>It is expected that in certain types of battles, an order of
losses (OOL) is requested unless both players agree beforehand on
something different. These battles include:</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>Defending multi-national forces</li>
<li>Defending land units where a bomber is present</li>
<li>Defending subs when enemy naval units are present</li>
<li>Defending naval units if more than one type is present</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is any doubt outside a typical battle, ensure you get an
OOL from your opponent before beginning the battle!</p>
<p>Here is some more on OOL protocol:</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>You MUST ask the defender for an OOL prior to rolling any dice,but after combat movement is completed, if it is a situation that calls for an OOL.</li>
<li>Since combat movement is completed, obviously you MUST go through at least one round of the attack once an OOL has been given.</li>
<li>The
OOL is because normally you would sit at same table and during
attack the other player would be there to remove units...for
example: if you're goal is to kill a transport of the other guy,
and then ask for an OOL and he decides he will keep it at all costs
knowing eventually he will win out, then the attacker can not then
decide he won't attack at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to ensure there is no issue here: set up and finish
all your combat moves and then send the file back to your opponent
and add OOL at the end of the game file and in the e-mail ask for
his OOL. Then once they reply, you can begin the combat.</p>

<h4>Edit Mode (and Editing)</h4>
<h5>PBEM Games</h5>
<p>Editing in PBEM games is not as forgiving as live games. In PBEM games, players have the opporunity to practice their moves as many times as they would like. And it also gives players the opportunity to save between movement phases for futher testing. With that said, editing in PBEM games are limited to; fixing game bugs (such as correct carrier movement) and fixing <strong>entirely</strong> missed placements (we wan't competitive games).</p>

<p>For example, let us run through a PBEM turn quickly. Once you recieve a game file, if you were to miss purchasing, you can simply reload the game file and purchase again, so editing is not needed.</p>
<p>For your combat move, you can run it in local mode as many times as you wish, so your move is final once PBEM dice combat rolls are made. For non-combat, once again you can have practiced this already. Furthermore, once combat is done, you could even make a save file right then. That way, if you press "Done" too quickly during non-combat movement, you can reload the save and fix it. This save file will also help if you forget to place while accidentally clicking past "Are you sure you don't want to place units" message. You can reload the save, redo NCM and then place again. Again, this highlights the importance of making saves during move stages, and practicing your turns.</p>
<br>
<h5>Lobby Ladder Games</h5>
<p>Given the popularity of the online game lobby, live ladder games are becoming more common place. Editing rules are going to be fairly similiar to PBEM games.</p><ul class="rules" id="lists">
<h6>Purchases</h6>
<p>If you completely forget to purchase, an edit should be allowed. There is no opporunity here to reload the save game like PBEM. We want real competitive ladder matches.</p>
<p>What if you click done in the middle of purchase? (this happens when you close the buy window and look at the board, then click Done accidently instead of buy again.) If you had 30ipc and you bought 1 tank, an edit should be allowed. If you had 30ipc and you spent 28ipc worth, an edit should is the discretion of your opponent. Disputes can be solved by contacting the administrators.</p>
<p>No matter what purchase edits you ask for (if they are waranted or not), they MUST be completed BEFORE you roll any combat, and should happen BEFORE you move ANY pieces on the board! If you start moving things around and decide to modify your buy, an edit is not guaranteed.</p>

<h6>Combat Move and Non-Combat Move</h6>
<p>The ladder is about competitive games. It is the responsibility of players to review the board before they press Done on each combat phase. By accepting a live ladder game, you are denying yourself the move-practicing opportunities in a PBEM game. Major strategical errors should generally be allowed to edit. An example would be protecting a capital by 1 infantry that blocks a tank column. Remember it is your responsibility to review the board, not your opponents responsibility to allow you an edit, do NOT expect minor edits to be allowed. Players MUST decide what level of editing they will allow before the game begins.</p>
<p>Problems and arguments revolving editing can be submitted to the admins for review IF a decision cannot be reached by the two players involved in the live game. The admins will use their best judgement to decide. The admins WILL weigh their decision on competitive gameplay. The admins are admins because of their experience and good attitude in our community.</p>

<h6>Placement</h6>
<p>If you forget to place and click done through placement phase, AND you miss the dialogue window, placement edit fixes are allowed. Remember we want competitive games.</p>
<p>If you have placed in the wrong spot, this needs to not only be declared instantly, are subject to similiar rules as the Combat Move and Non-Combat Move section.</p>
</ul>

<h2>4. Reporting Game Results</h2>
<p>Completed games can be reported by either player and should
be reported as soon as the result is certain.</p>
<p>To report a game, click on the <b>Report Match</b> link. The reporting
players name will be shown in the table's left column. To the right
of this are drop down boxes for the allies game and the axis game. 
Select a win or loss for the reporting player for each game. 
Finally click on the <b>Report</b> button.</p>
<p>After pressing report, there will be a confirmation page. Mistakes made in reporting games can only be corrected by the
administrators.  It is advisable to double check entries before
clicking the <b>Confirm Report</b> button. If a mistake is made, please go
to the TripleA War Club Revised Ladder section of the forums and advise an
Admin/Mod. Provide Name of players, Challenge ID number, and the
problem.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an option to Rate A Player. 
It is a karma based system, and positive or negative feedback can be left. 
Both players in a match can rate their opponent.</p>

<h2>5. Ratings System</h2>
<p>Calculation of new ratings uses the Elo rating system. Ratings 
calculation are done when a match is reported, so there can be influence from intermediate
rating changes as a result of other matches.</p>

<p>The formula for calculating the change in rating is based off the Elo ratings system. The war club uses the following setup:</p>
<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>Maximum rating difference is 350</li>
<li>K value for ratings < 2000 is 40</li>
<li>K value for ratings between 2000 and 2400 is 20</li>
<li>K value for ratings > 2400 is 10</li>
<li>Ratings calculation uses the minimum K value</li>
</ul>
<p>These larger K values are to account for differences between TripleA and chess. They will be reviewed in 6 months from the date above.</p>
<p>The calculations are as follows. If Player A wins both games, Player A's Score (S) is 1. A draw is S = 0.5 for both players, and a loss for Player A is score S = 0.</p>
<p>The ratings difference used is the value of Player A's current rating minus Player B's current rating. If the difference is greater then the maximum difference of 350, then 350 is used.</p>
<p>Elo uses expected scores in the calculations, they are calculated by:<br>
Player A's expected score is 1 / ( 1 + 10^( (Player B's rating) - (Player A's rating) / 400 ) ).<br>
Player B's expected score is 1 / ( 1 + 10^( (Player A's rating) - (Player B's rating) / 400 ) ).</p>
<p>Finally the new ratings are calculated by:<br>
Player A's new rating = (Player A's rating) + (Player A's K value) * ( (Player A's Score) - (Player A's Expected score) ).<br>
Player B's new rating = (Player B's rating) + (Player B's K value) * ( (Player B's Score) - (Player B's Expected score) ).</p>

<p>A player's Rank is a function of rating points, the breakdown is (army / navy):</p>

<ul class="rules" id="lists">
<li>General / Admiral : 1600+</li>
<li>Colonel / Ship-of-the-Line Captain : 1401 - 1600</li>
<li>Major / Lt. Commander : 1201 - 1400</li>
<li>Captain / First Lieutenant : 1001 - 1200</li>
<li>Lieutenant / Sub-Lieutenant : 801 - 1000</li>
<li>Sergeant / Petty officer : 601 - 800</li>
<li>Corporal / Leading Seaman : 401 - 600</li>
<li>Private / Seaman : 1 - 400</li>
</ul>

<p>The #1 player is rewarded with a special rank of Field Marshal / Admiral of the Fleet.</p>

<h2>6. Slow Play Penalty</h2>
<p>The minimum number of moves required per match is TWO (2) per week.
However, players should try to make at least 4 moves per week as a
courtesy to their opponent. A move is defined as taking a turn in
one of the games so making one move in the Allied game and one move
in the Axis game counts as two moves.</p><p>
Delays (sickness, vacation, moving, etc.) must be reported in the
Revised Ladder portion of the tripleawarclub.org forum. A player
who is delayed is expected to notify all of their opponents by
email. Failure to do this may result in loss of the match due to
slow play.</p><p>
If an opponent is taking longer than 7 days to make two moves, a
slow play warning may be sent by logging in to the ladder and
clicking on the <b>My Challenges</b> link. A list of your challenges is
displayed. An <b>SP</b> icon next to a name means the match is not
finished and a slow play warning may be sent to that player.
Clicking on the <b>SP</b> icon automatically generates an email
sent to both players. In 3 days another email will be sent. In 7
days a final email will be sent telling both players that the match
can be reported as a win for the warning player. Players can view
the status of their slow play warnings by clicking on
the<b>Slowplay</b> link.</p><p>
A player receiving a slow play warning can click on the link
contained in the email to disable it. It is expected that disabling
the warning means the player has sent their required moves.</p><p>
Players who are often inactive, receive many slow play warnings, or
abuse the system (i.e. disable the warning without sending their
moves) could have their account deleted by the
administrators.</p>
<p>Note that the Slow Play process does not automatically produce a
Win or Loss, it is only a mechanism to alert the other player that
you have been trying to contact them to complete a started game
before you consider their non-response a forfeit.</p>

<h2>7. Removal from a Ladder</h2>
<p>A player may leave a competition by clicking on the Leave Competition button on the menu. Their account is removed from the board and no more challenges
can be sent/received by that account. However their information is stored in the system if they want to reactivate at a later date.</p>
<p>All ongoing matches by the player who deleted their account are
forfeit. The other players gain the points from those matches as
normal.</p><p>
After ninety days (90) of inactivity, a player's account
can be deleted by the administrators. All relevent data is saved
should a player decide to become active again at a later point in
time (contact a Mod/Admin in the forums section if you are trying
to return to the ladder with an inactivated account).</p>
<h2>8. Rules Changes</h2>
<p>A player may submit a proposed rule change to the administrator.
The proposal will be open for every member for discussion and
voting in the "suggestions" topic of the war club forum. If a
majority of the players voting agree to the proposal within 14 days
of the posting, the proposal can become a new rule.</p>
